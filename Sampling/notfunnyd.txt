This is improperly installed roofing flashing, the shingles should be set up over the shingles. If you have a Insurance claim for hail and wind damage to your roofing shingles call a professional Louisiana roofing contractor to assist you in the insurance process. Roof Crafters LLC has decades of experience in all facets of roofing and many years in real estate and can guide you through the insurance claim, don't let your insurance company bully you by telling you that your roof is not damage when so many houses are getting reroofed in your neighborhood. Call a professional roofing contractor and get equal footing with your insurance company. http://theroofcrafters.com  http://louisianalandsource.com

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

AN COMMERCIAL NOT SHOWN IN AMERICA WITH A KID BUYING WHATEVER HE WANTS WITH HIS MOM'S "PERMISSION"
------------
~~FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM (@Channingnyoung) (@Channingyoung). LOVE YOU!~~So here's the story....
Awhile ago I started making videos for TheChanningShow. I wanted to do a "Stuffed Animal Dog show" and see how many other people did one as a video response (Was for my school).  
The first time I tried to record it this happened.... So then I made the video again and it turned out good.  

I asked my brother to put the good one up on youtube for me (cuz I don't know how).  When he saw this video on my camera he thought it was funny so he put it on youtube instead...
So.. That's the story... It's okay, you can laugh. I guess it is pretty funny.

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Teen Simba wants to be like Randy Savage (OOOOOH YEAAH)

So yeah, this is pretty much the manliest dub of anything in the entire world. The original idea was for me to sing this song in full voice, but after my friend Andre (VACTORDREAMER OOOOOOOOOOH YEAAAAHH) comically mentioned that it would be hilarious if Zazu was played by Randy Savage, I actually ended up deciding to take the idea seriously! He was also so kind to mix everything in, including the outstanding visuals you see here. You may be asking why it's so short. The answer is simple! The average man can't handle this amount of awesome after 30 seconds before passing out, which is shown visually through the blackout at the end OOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH

Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

This ones pretty long not sure if there is a good enough pay off but i had fun doing it 

spoiler alert here is the joke as written to me in an email


One day this old lady was watching an info-merrcial on tv. This person was selling a tool that you put on the top of your head and screw tight and it gives you instant lift and gets rid of bags under your eyes. She buys the product and uses it. She notice that there are still bags under eyed and continues to tighten it over and over again. She goes to the doctor to see what's wrong and explains to him everything thing about the tool. He then says to her, ma'am those aren't bags under your eyes. She says what are they then? The doctor replies, those are your breasts. The lady says, oh then this thing on my chin isn't a beard?

thanks fro the support, I really appreciate everything...
